**Quests**
- Quests can be hidden from the quest log (hidden quests)

**Object Click Actions:**
- Need to add conditions for having specific quests or not
- Distance conditions
- Quest completion/fail system
- Movement:
    - On click the object starts/stops moving, on a pre-determined path (waypoints or bezier curves?)
    - Parameters:
        - Is Moving - start the game already moving
        - Speed
        - Stopping Time - while moving, when the object is clicked and stops, how many seconds should it stay still before start to move again
        - Movement Type:
            - If we can only do 1, maybe the path is the most versatile, because it can be used for flying, underwater, and ground animals.
            - Path - using bezier curves
            - POLISH/NICE TO HAVE:
                - Waypoints - list of waypoints
                - Randomly - go forward and change direction from time to time
        - Obstacle avoidance or not

    - For example, you click on a tree or a rock, and out comes moving a hidden animal.
    - Parameters:
        - GameObject with actions
- Play sound
- Game Over action
