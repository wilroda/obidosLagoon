**Inventory system**

There is an inventory object that can have "tokens" in it.
Tokens are scriptable objets

**Level structure:**
- A scriptable object that contains the objects/animals to be found - tokens to be found
    - Data to be retrieved from this structure:
        - How many things to find to complete a level, to populate the quest log or other UI thingies.
        - The name of those things to populate the quest log.
        - Quest log might have "hidden" status, and only get some message when it is completed (extra bonus)

**Object Click Actions:**
- Modular system where each action is a sperate script that can be added to an object, this way objects can have various actions fire at the same time. For example I click on an animal to "find" it and at the same time it displays some dialogue.

Actions might have conditions, conditions are just sets of inventory items and/or distances to another object
All actions can be retrigerable or not

- Actions:
    - Find Object - Logic that triggers when and object is supposed to be found and count towards the quest objectives. Need to be redone, add tokens
        - Parameters to add:
            - Secret - objects that can be found but aren't necesseary to complete the mission - see extras above.
      
    - Dialogue
        - On click a speech bubble appears and stays visible for some time.
            - Parameters:
                - SpeechSource - Transform where the speech bubble points to - can be pointed towards a narrator
                - Text limited to 280 characters (tweet style)
                - Time it says visible
                - POLISH/NICE TO HAVE - Speech bubble pop uup/down animation
                - POLISH/NICE TO HAVE - Speech appears word by word
             
    - Movement:
        - On click the object starts/stops moving, on a pre-determined path (waypoints or bezier curves?)
        - Parameters:
            - Is Moving - start the game already moving
            - Speed
            - Stopping Time - while moving, when the object is clicked and stops, how many seconds should it stay still before start to move again
            - Movement Type:
                - If we can only do 1, maybe the path is the most versatile, because it can be used for flying, underwater, and ground animals.
                - Path - using bezier curves
                - POLISH/NICE TO HAVE:
                    - Waypoints - list of waypoints
                    - Randomly - go forward and change direction from time to time

    - Trigger Another Object's Actions:
        - For example, you click on a tree or a rock, and out comes moving a hidden animal.
        - Parameters:
            - GameObject with actions
    - Play sound
    - Game Over
      - Quest is "Find Amphybians", you press on a mamal, game over, restart
    - Go to another scene
      - When a quest is done, or if you click on a certain place: not navigation, idea is that whole system is reset after this
